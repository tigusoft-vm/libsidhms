Starting from this source code version, the community could add fixes, changes etc.

p.s. this is the new branch in our git:
where we will set in git MS as the authors
(for a moment there was released version in which all git data was set to us as git authors
instead of just git commiters; data files in that branch should be identical to this one)

based on information from:

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/sidh/
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mnaehrig/
it will be set to include Michael Naehrig and his email as main git author email
